# Academic Projects & Technical Reports

This repository contains a curated selection of final reports from academic projects completed during my BSc in Computer Science at Maastricht University.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a transparent overview of my experience with data analysis, systems design, experimentation, cyber security and technical documentation, particularly in contexts involving complex workflows, reproducibility, and ethical constraints.

## Scope of the Repository

The materials included here focus on:
- Data analysis and integration
- Systems and algorithmic design
- Experimental methodology and quantitative evaluation
- Database design and structured querying
- Cybersecurity and privacy analysis in controlled environments
- Technical reporting and documentation

Each project is presented with:
- A short project-specific README describing context and goals
- The final written report (PDF)

Code is not always included, either because the original repositories are private (university GitLab) or because sharing full coursework implementations is not appropriate. The emphasis is therefore on **analysis, methodology, and results**, rather than raw source code.

## Ethical and Academic Context

All projects:
- Were conducted as part of formal university coursework
- Took place in controlled academic or laboratory environments
- Followed institutional ethical and safety guidelines
- Involved group collaboration where applicable (authorship is acknowledged in the reports)

No confidential, personal, or sensitive real-world data is included in this repository.

## Selected Projects

Examples of projects included:
- Privacy and security threat analysis through controlled experimentation
- Data-driven analysis of public transport accessibility and socio-economic indicators
- Database design, normalization, and query optimization
- Strategic evaluation of open-source systems for public-sector use
- Machine learning experimentation and performance evaluation

Each project folder contains further details.
